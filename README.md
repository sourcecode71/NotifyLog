**NotifyLog** is a full-stack Node.js/NestJS microservice built with **clean architecture** and **SOLID principles**, designed for sending email/SMS notifications, logging messages/errors, and managing webhooks. Itâ€™s portable, modular, and paired with a Next.js/React frontend dashboard for visualizing notification and error log history. Features a **GraphQL API** for flexible querying.

## Clean Architecture
**NotifyLog** adheres to **clean architecture** and **SOLID principles**, ensuring modularity, testability, and maintainability. Key layers include:

- **Domain** (`apps/notifylog-api/src/domain/`): Defines interfaces (e.g., `INotificationRepository`, `IWebhookRepository`) for business logic, independent of frameworks (Single Responsibility).
- **Application** (`apps/notifylog-api/src/application/`): Implements business rules via factories (`NotificationFactory`) and strategies (`EmailNotificationStrategy`, `SMSNotificationStrategy`) (Dependency Inversion).
- **Infrastructure** (`apps/notifylog-api/src/infrastructure/`): Handles persistence (`prisma/schema.prisma`) and repositories (`NotificationRepository`, `WebhookRepository`) (Open/Closed).
- **Presentation** (`apps/notifylog-api/src/presentation/`): Exposes GraphQL APIs through resolvers (`NotificationResolver`, `WebhookResolver`, `LogResolver`) (Interface Segregation).

Shared utilities and logging are abstracted into `libs/` for reusability across apps.
